\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) are a powerful and flexible tool for generating numerical methods for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs).  RBF collocation methods are easily applied to solving PDEs on irregular domains using scattered node layouts~\cite{Bayona2010,Davydov2011,Wright200699}. RBF-based methods also generalize naturally to the solution of PDEs on manifolds $\mathbb{M}\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ using only the Euclidean distance measure in the embedding space and Cartesian coordinates; see for example~\cite{FlyerWright:2007,FlyerWright:2009,FuselierWright:2013,Piret2012,FoL11,FlyerLehto2012,SWFKJSC2014,Piret2016,Aiton2011,LSWSISC2017, SWJCP2018,SNKJCP2018}.
